<h3>Case Study Overview
</h3>
<p>In this case study, an organisation of Performance Art named Blast Theory set the design challenge to explore the concept of the uncertainty revolving around the history of the Viking Ship site at Gjellestad. While exploring the historical site and existing solutions, an immersive user experience idea was developed that can show the uncertainty of the past in an interactive and educational manner.

<h3>My Role and Used Tools

  <li>Tools: Miro, Figma</li>
  
  </ul>



<h3>Challenges and Problem Statement
</h3>
<p>In 2020, archaeologists excavated the ship grave at Gjellestad using ground-penetrating radar and other methods to gain knowledge about the ship area. However, there are still open questions about the site such as who was buried on the ship and whether the ship looks like other Viking boats known to us. Given these uncertainties, it can be challenging to introduce users to an unknown, uncertain, or ambiguous past of a historic event.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>The main goals for this case study were to:
</p>

<ul class="NAVtest"> <li>Create a storyboard that illustrates an experience that foregrounds the uncertainty about the history of Gjellestad.</li> <li>Create an interaction that gives the user a clear call to action, where their input completes the interaction experience and gives them a sense of payoff.</li> <li>Connect the experience to actual findings found during archaeological excavations.</li> </ul>

<h3>Research and story planning 
</h3>
<p>Since the design challenge is bound to an existing place and historic findings, it was of interest to do some background research to get an understanding of what events took place and how they could relate to the designed experience. After getting acquainted with Gjellestad’s history and recent archaeological excavations, it was certain that several ships and artefacts have been found on site.
</p>
<p>During the Viking Age, many items were made out of wood which made it hard to preserve them since wood buried in the soil would eventually rot and decompose over time. This fact unsurprisingly led to the idea that many artefacts partially or mostly made of wood were highly likely destroyed, leaving only, for instance, the metal parts behind. 
</p>
<p>During the research, other existing examples of interactive experiences of Gjellestad were found and analyzed. One interaction consisted of a 3D simulated world of Gjellestad where the user could visit and read about archaeologist findings and watch interviews of people working on site. The experience, however, felt not so engaging as it felt slow-paced and very linear, not giving the users the agency to explore the site on their own. This led to the motivation to create an experience that would engage the users, and educate them while simultaneously giving them more freedom in their exploration journey.
</p>
<p>To diverge from a linear storyline, it was reasonable to include a story involving some interaction elements and objectives for the users to take part in at their own pace. To connect the story and objectives to the ship, the first idea was to have an archaeologist character that asks users to excavate artefacts around the ship, and successively unlock more lore when artefacts are found. While the excavation in itself as an interaction idea is good, using an archaeologist from our times as the main character did not feel ideal. After more research on the Viking ship, I learned that the Viking ship at Gjellestad was likely a burial ship. That prompted the idea to connect the experience to a deceased person buried in the ship instead of the archaeologist. The goal would then be to find their lost belongings (relating to the artefacts that were intact and uncovered) to revive the memories that a person could once have had. This prompt also gives users a clear call to action and a reason as to why they are engaging in the interactive experience. The experience taking place from the perspective of the ghost (that they were there and witnessed it) could also feel more grounded and have a stronger feeling of connection to the past than using an archaeologist from today.
</p>

<h3>Experience Design
</h3>
<p>To communicate the interactive experience idea, a storyboard that takes place at the historical museum, following a family journey was created, these are the overarching steps:
</p>
<h4>Introducing the user to the site:
</h4>
<p>At this stage, the user gets to know the place and its holographic character. The character is represented as a Viking ghost who once lived on the ship Viking in a past life and now strives to remember his past. The character invites users to help him in his search for memories by searching for objects on the ground.
</p>

<h4>Familiarizing users with the unknown:
</h4>
<p>At this stage, the interaction nudges users to start forging a connection with the place and the Viking. The users get involved in finding archaeological objects, also indulging in richer conversation with the character, and more.
</p>
<h4>Strengthening user associations:
</h4>
<p>In the final stages, the interactions are aimed to invoke sentiments in users and strengthen their connection with the history of the ship.
</p>
<p>Here is the whole storyboard, describing each frame: 
</p>
<p>ADD ALL IMAGES + text
  Outline for the storyboard:
  Family in the museum (They can see the sign “Till 850”)
  Holding hands with map (Pointing hand)
  Family is meeting Olaf(generated name) in zone “till 850”
  Welcome screen (no tools)
  Pointing to the zone with tools (Pointing hand)
  Family is following AI for tools
  The family is going to a guided zone (zones are spotlighted)
  Process of finding object
  Add the found object to the log
  AI starts conversation
  Everything was found in this era (You see the complete level with all objects they found)
  AI saying something about the era
  The family looks happy and moves towards the next room
  Entering the ship room with a top view, sees all the things collected there, happy days.
  </p>

<h3>Conclusion/Reflection:
</h3>
<p>Creating an engaging and informative experience while introducing users to unfamiliar, uncertain, and ambiguous concepts is a challenging task. The interactions should have a clear purpose while being easy to follow. They should also be able to evoke emotions within users before revealing the final product and outcomes. To achieve this it’s important to keep the user’s perspective in mind and tailor the experience to their needs. </p>
