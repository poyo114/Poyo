        <h3>Case Study Overview
        </h3>
        <p>In this case study, an organisation of Performance Art named Blast Theory set the design challenge to explore
          the concept of the uncertainty revolving around the history of the Viking Ship site at Gjellestad. While
          exploring the historical site and existing solutions, an immersive user experience idea was developed that can
          show the uncertainty of the past in an interactive and educational manner.

        <h3>Challenges and Problem Statement
        </h3>
        <p>In 2020, archaeologists excavated the ship grave at Gjellestad using ground-penetrating radar and other
          methods to gain knowledge about the ship area. However, there are still open questions about the site such as
          who was buried on the ship and whether the ship looks like other Viking boats known to us. Given these
          uncertainties, it can be challenging to introduce users to an unknown, uncertain, or ambiguous past of a
          historic event.
        </p>

        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <p>The main goals for this case study were to:
        </p>

        <ul class="NAVtest">
          <li>Create a storyboard that illustrates an experience that foregrounds the uncertainty about the history of
            Gjellestad.</li>
          <li>Create an interaction that gives the user a clear call to action, where their input completes the
            interaction experience and gives them a sense of payoff.</li>
          <li>Connect the experience to actual findings found during archaeological excavations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lastP"></p>
        </div>
      
        <div class="innerContainer">
        <h3>Research and story planning
        </h3>
        <p>Since the design challenge is bound to an existing place and historic findings, it was of interest to do some
          background research to get an understanding of what events took place and how they could relate to the
          designed experience. After getting acquainted with Gjellestad’s history and recent archaeological excavations,
          it was certain that several ships and artefacts have been found on site.
        </p>
        <p>During the Viking Age, many items were made out of wood which made it hard to preserve them since wood buried
          in the soil would eventually rot and decompose over time. This fact unsurprisingly led to the idea that many
          artefacts partially or mostly made of wood were highly likely destroyed, leaving only, for instance, the metal
          parts behind.
        </p>
        <p>During the research, other existing examples of interactive experiences of Gjellestad were found and
          analyzed. One interaction consisted of a 3D simulated world of Gjellestad where the user could visit and read
          about archaeologist findings and watch interviews of people working on site. The experience, however, felt not
          so engaging as it felt slow-paced and very linear, not giving the users the agency to explore the site on
          their own. This led to the motivation to create an experience that would engage the users, and educate them
          while simultaneously giving them more freedom in their exploration journey.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
        <img src="image 2.png" alt="">
        <img src="image 3.png" alt="">
      </div>
        
        <p>To diverge from a linear storyline, it was reasonable to include a story involving some interaction elements
          and objectives for the users to take part in at their own pace. To connect the story and objectives to the
          ship, the first idea was to have an archaeologist character that asks users to excavate artefacts around the
          ship, and successively unlock more lore when artefacts are found. While the excavation in itself as an
          interaction idea is good, using an archaeologist from our times as the main character did not feel ideal.
          After more research on the Viking ship, I learned that the Viking ship at Gjellestad was likely a burial ship.
          That prompted the idea to connect the experience to a deceased person buried in the ship instead of the
          archaeologist. The goal would then be to find their lost belongings (relating to the artefacts that were
          intact and uncovered) to revive the memories that a person could once have had. This prompt also gives users a
          clear call to action and a reason as to why they are engaging in the interactive experience. The experience
          taking place from the perspective of the ghost (that they were there and witnessed it) could also feel more
          grounded and have a stronger feeling of connection to the past than using an archaeologist from today.

        <h3>Experience Design
        </h3>
        <p>
          To communicate the concept of an interactive experience, we developed a storyboard set in a historical museum, following a family’s journey. To make the experience more digestible, we divided the storyboard into fewer high-level steps, each having  4 images from the storyboard and their descriptions.
        </p>
        <h4>Introducing the user to the site:
        </h4>
        <p>At this stage, the user gets to know the place and its holographic character. The character is represented as
          a Viking ghost who once lived on the ship Viking in a past life and now strives to remember his past. The
          character invites users to help him in his search for memories by searching for objects on the ground.
        </p>

          <div class="image-item">

            <p>2. The family looks at the map and points to the beginning of the experience.

          <div class="image-item">
            <img src="3.png" alt="">
            <p>3. The family meets Olaf the viking ghost outside the sign “till 850”. Olaf asks them for help to revive his memories by finding artefacts that he has lost. 
              </p>

            <p>4.The family agrees to help and follows Olaf to the tools where Olaf explains how they work.</p>
          </div>
        </div>


        <h4>Familiarizing users with the unknown:
        </h4>
        <p>At this stage, the interaction nudges users to start forging a connection with the place and the Viking. The
          users get involved in finding archaeological objects, also indulging in richer conversation with the
          character, and more.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h4>Strengthening user associations:
        </h4>
        <p>In the final stages, the interactions are aimed to invoke sentiments in users and strengthen their connection
          with the history of the ship.

        <h3>Conclusion/Reflection:
        </h3>
        <p>Creating an engaging and informative experience while introducing users to unfamiliar, uncertain, and
          ambiguous concepts is a challenging task. The interactions should have a clear purpose while being easy to
          follow. They should also be able to evoke emotions within users before revealing the final product and
          outcomes. To achieve this it’s important to keep the user’s perspective in mind and tailor the experience to
          their needs. </p>
