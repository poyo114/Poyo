    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>With a background in computer science, my initial plan was to become a software engineer. But quite quickly I realised it was not for me since I felt disconnected from the purpose and impact of my work. I missed the human element of understanding why and for whom we create things. Then I started to dig further into understanding user experience. To equip myself with tools to identify and approach problems in a more structured and prepared manner,  I decided to expand and narrow down my knowledge and pursue a master's in interactive media technology. While my computer science background has been invaluable (I would imply that there is no time wasted here) it is reassuring to know that I will probably never be the designer with unrealistic ideas that would be too demanding to code and not really that not user-friendly.

    <h4>Hobbies</h4>
    <p>Like seasons, my hobbies do rotate from time to time. These seasonal rotations include:</p>
<ul class="NAVtest">
  <li>🎨 Creating art</li>
  <li>🧶 Crocheting</li>
  <li>🌱 Plants</li>
  <li>🎮 Playing games</li>
  <li>📚 Reading books</li>
  <li>🐱 Always cats </li>
</ul>

    <h3>UX Process
    </h3>
    <p>While there is often a lack of a unanimous definition of what the tasks of a UX designer's responsibilities are, I believe it's worth mentioning my approach to the design process. It's important to note that there's no one-size-fits-all explanation but one size could fit better than others, adapting the UX process to user needs is essential. 🙂 In this context, the double diamond method is a great way to an overview of the design process, following these steps:
    </p>

    <ul class="NAVtest">
      <li><strong>Finding Problems:</strong> This involves exploring and gaining insights into the problem space.</li>
      <li><strong>Define Problems:</strong> Narrowing down the problem space to a clear and concise definition.</li>
      <li><strong>Shape a Solution:</strong> Creating and evaluating potential solutions for the defined problem, iterating until satisfied.</li>
      <li><strong>Deliver the Solution:</strong> Presenting the final product and identifying areas for continuous improvement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Throughout the process, UX designers are equipped with a toolbox of different methods that could be used throughout the designing journey.
