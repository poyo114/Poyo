        <h3>Case Study Overview
        </h3>
        <p>This case study explores the issue of online privacy and how often users are unaware of the amount of data
          that is collected about them all the time. The goal of this case study was to design a solution that raises
          awareness for users' online presence and facilitates making changes based on user preferences. To achieve this
          goal, a web browser extension Pawse was designed to help users be in control of their information.
        </p>

        <h3>My Role and Used Tools
        </h3>


        <ul class="NAVtest">
          <li>Role: UX Researcher</li>

          <li>Tools: Miro, Figma</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Challenges/Problem Statement
        </h3>
        <p>Privacy policies for different applications are often too textual and time-consuming to read, and due to the
          overwhelming amount of text, users tend to blindly accept terms and conditions, cookies and other disclaimers
          on different applications. This increases the risk of their private information being collected, further
          amplifying their digital footprint that users may not be aware of.
        </p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>To aid users in providing transparency about their online presence, the goal for this case study is to
          develop an extension that:
        </p>
        <ul class="NAVtest">
          <li>Keeps the user aware and in control of the data they generate and provide about themselves.
          </li>
          <li>Makes reading policies more digestible for users to understand what they are consenting to online.</li>
          <li>Is intuitive and easily accessible when you browse.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Research/Analysis
        </h3>
        <p>Since online privacy and awareness is a huge topic with different areas of interest, it was essential to
          understand the problem space better. To begin with, it was of interest to research the current state of the
          topic, including current research, user/consumer point of view and current existing products tackling the same
          problem as stated before.
        </p>
        <h3>Users POV
        </h3>
        <p>Before designing a solution for users, it made sense to ask users themselves what they value and what they
          want when it comes to their online presence. Therefore we created a questionnaire to better understand users’
          habits online, what information they find important, what they were not aware of etc.
        </p>
        <p>9 participants partook in the questionnaire, the majority of whom were women between 18-25 years old. The
          results were summarized into smaller bullet points where the most interesting insights were:
        </p>

        <ul class="NAVtest">
          <li>Most of the responders have never read a privacy policy in full before agreeing to it.
          </li>
          <li>All of the participants were aware of online tracking.
          </li>
          <li>Most of the responders think that personal data is just personal and should not be used for any purpose.
            However, another significant group thinks that data could be used for research purposes or by employers.
          </li>
          <li>Most of the participants think that their data could be subject to breach.
          </li>
          <li>Users wish for more control over data, easy to delete, and stricter regulations on social media platforms.
          </li>
          <li>Social media platforms should offer more user-friendly support and online information to help users manage
            their online identity. Schools and friends can also be great resources for learning how to manage one’s
            online presence.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Given these answers and some affinity mapping, the main challenge is to create a solution that enables users
          to easily view their data and access permissions, while also providing them with greater control over their
          online identity and making information more digestible.
        </p>

        <h3>Competitor analysis
        </h3>

        <p>Before we started designing our extension, we first did a deep dive and analysed similar tools to understand
          what is already on the market, the good, the bad and the potential areas of improvement of each application.
          As a summary, we looked at the following extensions: </p>

        <ul class="NAVtest">
          <li><strong>EditThisCookie:</strong> A popular cookie extension, that does its job providing what sites have
            which cookies but the UI looks awful.</li>
          <li><strong>HTTPS Everywhere:</strong> Automatically uses HTTPS security on many sites.</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy badger:</strong> Sees and blockers potential trackers on different websites, UI could be
            better.</li>
          <li><strong>Click&Clean:</strong> Deletes typed URLs. Cache, Cookies, your Download and Browsing history just
            with a 1-click button, however, does not add to the solution of online privacy awareness.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The main takeaway from this analysis was that there are several browser extensions available, but none of
          them have all the functionalities in one while being intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. It was then set to
          suggest designing a coherent extension that has several functionalities in one extension (rather than needing
          to have an extension for each) and is intuitive to use without compromising its appearance. It is also
          important to keep in mind that a lot of these extensions included words/functionalities that may be not so
          straightforward to not-so-tech-savvy people (like HTTPS and trackers), creating a risk of lacking an
          understandable language for all users
        </p>

        <h3>Eliciting ideas and designing the prototype
        </h3>
        <p>Together with the previous research we (a team consisting of 3 designers) continued on a brainstorming
          exercise journey and decided to do the Crazy Eights. Here each designer had 1 minute to sketch different ideas
          of some functionalities that the extension would have. Here several ideas popped up such as having a 3D avatar
          of your “known” to the internet persona, surveillance alerts to make users more aware of possible trackers, or
          a more provocative visualization of a home where the bricks are the 3rd parties that have access to your
          information.
        </p>
        <p>After this brainstorming exercise, one thing that felt flat was how we interact with the extension, would it
          be through the extension bar? Just an icon on the side? It felt as if there was no room for other interactions
          or easy access to information. By that, I proposed to have an avatar in the shape of a bear to accompany the
          user on their web browser. The bear would be able to provide different overviews for users of all cookies and
          how much other websites or applications know about them online.
        </p>

        <h3>The Extension Design for Digital Footprint
        </h3>
        <p>*Note that I did not participate in the hi-fi creation of the prototype, only the lo-fi as well as all the
          research done before.
        </p>
        <p>In this design stage, we continued to further develop the privacy browser extension idea containing a bear.
          We named the extension “Pawse” as it is something that bears have (paws) and something that the extension is
          capable of doing (pause and make aware). The main functionalities of this extension are that it provides users
          with a holistic overview of cookies and how websites and applications collect their data. The extension uses a
          brown bear avatar as a gamification element to make privacy awareness and education more engaging and easier
          to digest. It also breaks down privacy policies into shorter and easy-to-understand terms, giving users more
          control over their data and what they are about to sign up for. This extension is intended to be used on
          different web browsers, both on mobile and computer devices. After some design iterations, we finalized the
          prototype by creating an MVP.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion and further developments
        </h3>
        <p>We created the extension Pawse to address the common issue of users mindlessly accepting all cookies and
          other policies without understanding their implications. Our research for this case study showed that users
          wanted more transparency and control over who gets access to their data and when. The existing cookie
          management tools were not intuitive enough and often failed to effectively inform users about their privacy.
          By creating Pawse we give users more agency to make informed decisions about their online data. Given the
          state of the MVP, the next steps in this process would be to do some more iterations of user testing on the
          functionalities of the prototype, further shaping the product to adhere to user needs.
