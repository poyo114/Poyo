        <h3>Case study Overview</h3>
        <p>In 2023 I spent the majority of the year on my thesis project. Due to the UX focus and a rather relevant
          topic (as of 2023) of this project, I decided to add it to my portfolio. Here I can walk you through my work,
          the methods that I used and overall reflections on what was good and what could have been better. This thesis
          work was done at a company and the main focus was to explore how we can integrate using Generative AI tools
          within a designer’s workflow and how that might affect the designer's role as a whole.
        </p>
        <h3>My Role and Used Tools</h3>
        <ul class="NAVtest">
          <li>            Role: UX Researcher
          </li>
        <li>Tools: Miro, Canva, Figma</li>  
          </ul>
        
        <h3>Challenges and Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>Ever since the launch of ChatGPT in late November 2022 Generative AI tools had a boom in popularity.
          Throughout the year 2023, we could see an increase in different applications getting these “magic” or “smart”
          components which are generative AI tools themselves. Legal issues aside - regarding for instance intellectual
          property or plagiarism in general with generated content - one area of interest is to investigate how such
          technologies could impact one's work when introduced.
        </p>
        <h3>Project’s aim
        </h3>
        <p>The primary for this project is to research the topic of human-AI interactions and imagine different
          scenarios where Generative AI is used with the research question:</p>

        <i> “How might designers envision generative AI tools being integrated into future workflows?”
        </i>
        <p>Also please note that with “future” I am looking at near-future scenarios (taking place within some years
          from now), to have results that are a bit more tangible and not too dystopian for instance robots taking over
          the world.

        </p>
        <h3>Related Research
        </h3>
        <p>During the literature analysis on the topic of human-AI interactions, some studies were found looking at for
          instance human-AI interaction when ideating, as a tool for inspiration and as a drawing companion. Something
          these studies had in common was the concept of the "human in control" where humans tend to control the AI and
          not the other way around. This emphasizes the importance of human judgment in the AI process.
        </p>
        <p> Human-centric AI was also mentioned when developing AI applications, where the interactions were moving
          towards the “Missing middle – where human and machine collaboration is most effective. In this context, we
          already have identified some strengths and weaknesses of both humans and machines such as human creativity and
          adaptability, and machine analytical skills and speed). However, we need to continue exploring these skills as
          new technologies emerge and also be open to imagining more collaborative scenarios where human-AI
          collaboration becomes even more integrated into longer processes, such as design processes.</p>
        <p>Other human-AI co-creative collaborations where AI plays an integral part in a process to enhance human
          creativity. A study on typeface design made by Zeng et al. came up with a framework defining creativity as the
          continuous interplay between creation and reflection, where AI could aid humans in the creation processes
          (generating new typefaces based on different fonts and their readability) while humans engaged in reflecting
          on the results and iterating based on found areas of improvement. However, it is important to note that
          creativity together with AI can vary depending on what the task is, differentiating using AI in for instance
          iterating many versions of something for inspiration vs using AI to generate complete things.
        </p>

        <h3>Prestudy </h3>
        <p>Apart from the literature review, I did a prestudy to better understand the topic, and how I wanted to
          approach it including which methods to use. This was done by firstly conducting two interviews with two
          designers who were both experienced with AI. The interviews provided insights into how designers relate to the
          current state of generative AI tools and how they could be deployed at different stages throughout the design
          process. The interviews also gave insights into how designers relate to their work and how that could be
          affected if AI is integrated into the process without careful consideration.
        </p>
        <p>Other than that, ideas of designers working together on envisioning different scenarios of using AI came up.
          I therefore evaluated to assess the feasibility of potential workshops, where designers would interact with AI
          tools themselves. This involved me acquainting myself with available AI tools and examining their
          accessibility, functionalities of each tool and their reliability.
        </p>

        <h3>Method </h3>
        <p>I used research-through-design as the core approach with the inquiry to generate new knowledge regarding the
          topic of designer-AI collaboration. This type of approach was deemed suitable as it benefits exploration over
          hypothesis testing. Since the topic has a future-oriented direction, using design fictions as a framework was
          chosen to facilitate imagining different scenarios that “do not yet exist”. These fictions were then made
          during workshops where participants could create and reflect in a collaborative setting. The recordings of the
          workshop as well as everything created during them, would then be used as the core data for thematic analysis.
        </p>
        <h3>Procedure </h3>
        <p>In total, three workshops were held with 9 participants (all different types of designers). Each workshop
          spanned around 2 hours with the main goal of creating and discussing possible desirable and undesirable
          futures or scenarios of using AI in your workflow, also situating in the near future. The participants also
          had to use AI tools in the process.
        </p>
        <p>Each participant was provided with their own board space in a shared MIRO document where they could add any
          thoughts and creations. Here's an example of a board:
        </p>
        <p>As a reflection, letting participants share a collaborative space online while sitting next to each other
          created an atmosphere of participants being able to swiftly work on their separate tasks while also being
          present and being able to discuss with each other at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>Also for future studies, the duration of each workshop was arguably too short. Within 2 hours participants
          were expected to access the tools, get acquainted with the tools (since not everyone has interacted with
          generative AI before this workshop) create design fictions and present them. Having limited time to create
          futures might have pressured participants, potentially disrupting their creative processes. In this case, it
          could have been more productive to either extend the duration of the workshop sessions or split them into
          multiple occasions, where the same participants could spend more time reflecting by themselves between
          sessions.
        </p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>As for the results, I’m going to choose some of the scenarios that were created and present them here under
          common themes. On top of that, Inspired by the results, I also created a small design fiction of a user manual
          (have to keep the legacy) on how to interact with an AI tool in 2025.
        </p>
        <p>To make this section more digestible, I will keep it short and provide quotes from the participants
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p>The first topic found was identifying and automating current mundane tasks with the help of AI. The mundane
          tasks in this case were described as tasks that are monotone and in some cases do not really need a designer's
          expertise to do them, such as:
        </p>

        <p><i>“automatically make layout details adhere to the company's design language”</i>
          <i> “making the interactive parts for prototypes. working with lots of raw data, transcripts and
            questionnaires”</i> and
          <i> “more automating administrative processes.”
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>The second topic was learning with AI, where AI has the potential to help designers learn different things.
          This could mean, for instance, creating a AI personal trainer, to tailor <i>"what you need" </i>based on
          experience, facilitating the onboarding process or expanding a skill set. Access to AI could also help
          designers in pursuing some ideas that require other competence, making you <i>“not avoiding a good solution
            because you feel you do not have the competence for it”.</i> However, the ease of access to knowledge from
          AI tools could also discourage independent learning as designers may perceive little value in spending time
          acquiring knowledge if it does not offer immediate competitive advantages - <i>“Why waste time learning
            something if it wouldn't be an advantage within a year?"</i>
        </p>

        <p>The third topic was transforming the idea of testing. Here, several participants came up with different
          scenarios where generative AI would be present in user testing.
        </p>
        <p>Imagine a user test lab with these scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul class="NAVtest">
          <li>1. AI could take on the role of the facilitator (being judged by a machine might be perceived as less
            intimidating).
          </li>
          <li>
            2. AI could mimic a target group based on specific parameters provided by the facilitator. This would
            involve essentially<i>“feeding personas to AI.”</i>

          </li>
          <li>3. A scenario could be created where both the facilitator and participants are AI.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using AI instead of people could pose the risk of not adequately representing the actual target group, as they would be replaced by our and AI's assumptions about who they are and what they want. However, it could be utilized as a quality assurance step before testing with the target group.
        </p>
        <p>Then the last topic was AI, creativity and the role of the designer. Regarding creativity, most participants agreed that generative AI is not inherently creative. While it can generate new combinations, it lacks the same creative capabilities as humans. This places designers in a unique position to harness AI as a tool for augmenting their creativity rather than replacing it.</p>
        <p>Participant P8 suggested using AI to test one's creativity or benchmark one's knowledge against current state-of-the-art practices. This approach can help designers identify areas for improvement and make sure their ideas are truly novel and innovative, because if AI is aware of it, then chances are the idea is not novel.
        </p>
        <p>Participant P1 emphasized that relying solely on AI for creativity can be counterproductive stating: “If you just generate it, you don't have the experience of having done it, you can't really understand where you can improve it”. So without hands-on experience, designers may not fully understand their creations and may struggle to refine them well.
        </p>
        <p>Lastly, several participants acknowledged the importance of human-centric design education and that it will be needed in the coming years when AI-driven design becomes more common. 
        </p>

<h3>Discussion </h3>
<p>Based on the results I think it is important that human-AI collaboration should be seen as an adaptation process needing collective input. To enhance collaboration and address the "missing middle," we discussed the potential of assigning mundane tasks to AI while ensuring the preservation of human strengths and machine capabilities. While AI in a workflow could save time, we should not forget about the possibility of new mundane tasks arising, such as quality assurance of AI outputs, since there will be a lot of data to check. The checking would probably take less time than doing it manually - in turn, making more time for <i>meaningful</i> work (which was identified as being creative). This however raises a question of whether being creative all the time would become too demanding and increase the overall mental workload for designers. Apart from mundane tasks, AI can also serve as a valuable tool in the ideation process, and redefine how we view creativity as a whole. Using AI will not automatically make your things less creative, but it has the role of a mediator assisting you in your creative process. Again, there is a big difference between using AI for completing whole tasks vs using it as a part of a process, you as a designer still carry the responsibility of understanding the design process.
</p>

<p>If you remember the belief that humans should be in control from the extended background section, it is about to change when working with AI. Allocating tasks to AI simultaneously invites us to discuss how this control is not static and will have to change with AI integration. As for integration, there will be no truly one-size-fits-all, since we do work differently. I can however imagine it is easier to have a uniform approach for mundane tasks, but not for your creative processes, where even participants had divided opinions. 
</p>

<p>As for education, generative AI could be a great tool to especially help you pursue impossible ideas and, in turn, lower the barrier to entry. The important thing is that you need to have the <i>willingness</i> to learn and try and hopefully not be too stuck and comfortable with a set of design patterns that "do work". There is a need for continuous AI education, which includes education of employees, specifically to omit the risks of “collaboration messiness”, where you have access to different generative AI tools but you don't know how to use them effectively.  AI tools also have to be kept alive, as they don't have a linear "becoming better" without humans in the loop, where we collectively provide feedback to make the algorithms better where <i>“Humans and technology are always co-constitutive and evolving together”.</i>
</p>
<p>In the case of the designer role, which includes an array of different types of designers, it is hard to imagine the designer role as a whole will cease to exist.
  But with the integration of AI, it could be changed. Given design being part of everything in one way or another brings up the question of whether it would be more beneficial if — with the help of AI — other professionals could also become designers, helping them design for their own needs, and in this way democratising design. Another possibility is the creation of a sub-category of designers with their own methodology and titles focusing on AI.</p>

  <h3>Future works
  </h3>
  <p>I think one thing this thesis accomplished is to identify a plethora of other research projects that one could do. There is a lot to explore, for instance, the Designers' role in HCAI; what will designers need to know? What is considered HCAI? How will it (priorities) change? Another research idea would be to have cross-team workshops on AI integration where designers and for instance, AI experts would collaborate and exchange knowledge and perspectives about functionalities at both technical and human-centric levels, also with a design thinking approach.
  </p>

  <h3>More reflections
  </h3>
  <p>One critique that I got from my examiner during my defence that stood out was my rather Naive attitude towards AI integration, as my writing could be seen as a bit too optimistic. One way to put it I in one way wrote about AI and creating an illusion of choice, that using such tools is up to the individual, whatever works best for you etc. However, who decides that really? Also regarding the missing middle, even if it's a great idea on paper, people will still lose jobs. If designers allow AI to take over some of the workloads -  in turn saving time - it could mean that we will not need as many designers as we currently have, leading to fewer jobs. </p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p>This was an exploratory study aimed at generating knowledge on the topic of AI integration. The study revealed a lot of possibilities for AI to enhance design processes, but it also highlighted the need for careful consideration. Especially since these types of technologies are something that is always changing, we also need to adapt to them.
