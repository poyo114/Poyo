  <p> I have played lots of different games for a while now and have always enjoyed immersing myself and taking part in new worlds, with new stories and characters. That has also inspired me to try to create my own games and digital environments.

        <h4>Collecting Tasty Foods</h4>
        <p>This catch game had one main objective: catch good foods (different foods from Eastern Europe) and avoid the bad ones. This game was also part of a modality evaluation where we compared button control against tilt. It was measured by the accuracy of good objects caught under a limited amount of time. In, short the button modality performed better accuracy-wise but both modalities were appreciated by the participants.   </p>
        <p>Since it was a group project, I will only add some of the graphics that I did myself below:</p>

        <p>When researching the word "introvert" it was found that introverts often have a hard time participating in group chats. To make the interaction easier we decided to create an app chat space of space with planets where each planet represents an interest chosen by the user. I created a storyboard and a video demonstration to better convey the isolation a user could experience and how the application could help sort the conversations:</p>

<p id="uniqueDesc"> First step in the particular photogrammetry method is to take photos of a project from a lot of different angles:</p>
